# KOBO Card Game
Game of Kobo in digital version! Currently work in progress.
This version of KOBO is a two player game. Each player takes turn and tries to lower the sum of their points as much as possible. The player with the lowest count wins!

## How to play?
1. Each player gets 4 cards but can only flip and see 2 of them at the beginning of the game.
2. Players take turns and draw one card from the remaining deck or from the rejected cards deck (which are facing up). Player decides if they want to replace one of their cards with the new one or get rid of it.
3. When player gets rid of a card they do it so that the opponent can also see what card it was. No matter if the rejected card was the replaced one or the newly drawn one.
4. If the value of the rejected card matches with one (or more) cards from the player's deck they can get rid of it - no matter whose turn it is. For example you can throw away 6 of any suits on the 6 that your opponent just rejected.
5. The goal of the game is to have the lowest possible sum of card values. If your feeling confident in your score simply shout "KOBO!". Your opponent makes their last turn and you both reveal your counts to each other. **One with the lowest sum wins!**

## What values do the cards have?
Going up from Ace through 2 to 10 ending at Jack, Queen and King the values consecutively go from 1 to 13. There is an exception though: both red Kings' values are 0.
